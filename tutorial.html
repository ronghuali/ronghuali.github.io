				<h4>Title </h4>
				<p>Cohesive subgraph search on large graphs: concepts and algorithms</p>
			</div>
			<div class="con01_t">
				<h4>Abstract </h4>
				<p>The problem of finding cohesive subgraphs from a large graph is a fundamental problem in graph data mining which has attracted much attention in recent years due to a large number of practical applications. In this tutorial, I will first introduce two widely-used cohesive subgraph models: k-core and k-truss. Then, I will present a peeling algorithm and an h-index iteration algorithm to efficiently compute the k-core and k-truss decomposition on large graphs. Finally, I will introduce some generalized k-core concepts and algorithms on attributed and temporal graphs.  </p>
